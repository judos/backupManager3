- Possible late update:
show progress during executing large operations on data
change architecture of file operation to:
	- fileoperation:traverseTree(Consumer<File> file)
	- fileoperation abstract calculateWorkOf(File f)
	- fileoperation abstract executeOperationOn(File f)
to allow global async execution

show remaining time estimate
	store constant time for checking backup paths
	store measurement (elements+data -> time)
		model: elements * c1 + data * c2 = time
